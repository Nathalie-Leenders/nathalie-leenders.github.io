&lt;p>You have a sharepoint list with birthdays, on a date column, but dont know how to filter on them to show the last few days or upcoming few days if someone has (had) their birthday.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I couldnt figure out how to do this, and then a colleague of mine Remco Bruijstens (thank you!) suggested this method, and after testing it worked.
Kudos to him, and I wanted to share with you how to accomplish this.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Custom document link sharing with Sharepoint and Power Automate</title><link>https://blog.nathalieleenders.com/posts/sharepointlibrarypermissions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Sep 2023 09:27:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nathalieleenders.com/posts/sharepointlibrarypermissions/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="usecase">Usecase&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You need to share a file from sharepoint to an external user, in an automated process. No manual &amp;lsquo;create link&amp;rsquo; actions needed on the sharepoint site. You can then email this link to your external client.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Default on Power automate for a sharing link for sharepoint, is to set the Link Scope to either:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Anyone with the link (including anonymous)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>People in your organization&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This explains how you can use the &amp;lsquo;people with existing access&amp;rsquo; sharing type.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
