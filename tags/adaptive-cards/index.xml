&lt;p>You want to show a report in Microsoft Teams, or when someone requests a sales overview of 2022, a card appears with that report in it. You can also of course set up Powerbi alerts as a trigger.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Right now, natively, dynamic reports do not work in cards. However, at MPPC they did announce this is possibly coming!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For now though, here is a way to make this possible.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dynamic content not displaying my action</title><link>https://blog.nathalieleenders.com/posts/dynamiccontent/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jun 2023 00:27:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nathalieleenders.com/posts/dynamiccontent/</guid><description>&lt;p>I came across this today and wanted to share. I couldnt figure out why my output from the teams adaptive card was not an option to select in my Compose (no body or anything available). &amp;#x1f62d;&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="scenario">Scenario:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You have an action in your flow, for example a teams adaptive card, and want to use the output somewhere. Whether thats in a compose, set variable, update row, doesnt matter. What you try and do, it wont show.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Get output from Adaptive Card choice sets</title><link>https://blog.nathalieleenders.com/posts/adaptivecards/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Oct 2022 14:27:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nathalieleenders.com/posts/adaptivecards/</guid><description>&lt;p>Adaptive cards is the name for the pop-up you can get in Teams, with custom content asking you to confirm something, or to submit a remark.
One way of creating them is through Adaptive card Designer (JSON).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another way is to use the new Cards (preview) method in PowerApps maker - find out how here: Microsoft Learn Page - &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/cards/overview/?wt.mc_id=DX-MVP-5005318" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/cards/overview/?wt.mc_id=DX-MVP-5005318&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to use your adaptive card as for example an approval, or you want the color choice you need to get the data that the card receives.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
