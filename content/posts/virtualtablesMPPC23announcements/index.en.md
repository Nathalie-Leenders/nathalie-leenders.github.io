## MPPC 2023 - Getting to announce brand new features!

As some of you may have noticed during my MPPC session, I've been honored to work together with 2 absolute rockstars within Microsoft, to fact check my Virtual Table information, and to get amazing new announcements out there!

[Pranita Padalwar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pranita225/) Senior Product Manager for Power Pages, very generously provided information I could share for Power Pages which is so amazing I cannot wait to show you here!

And then [Nathan Helgren](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nhelgren/) Principal Program Manager Dataverse, and allround Expert on anything Virtual Table related, also tremendously helped me with fact checking my content, making sure I captured everything I could, and provide me with his own brand new shiny screenshots and details.

As you can imagine it was really hard to keep this quiet (but I managed, thankfully, my NDA trust is still intact, lol)

Then, at MPPC, during Nathan's own session, he ran out of time to announce something first, leaving me with the exclusive to announce during my session, and now I get to share it here as well!!

So without further ado and introduction, here are the 2 announcements:

## ALM Coming to Virtual Tables

You can now add your own environment variables during the move in ALM for Virtual Tables!

It will give you the option in the wizard to add the names in there.

## Power Pages - Filter icon changed

You can filter on virtual or regular on the add table interface, and the icon has also changed to differentiate between the types of tables, Virtual vs Dataverse

## Power Pages - Directly create a virtual table from the interface!

Currently you can add an existing virtual table to Power Pages, however….

You can now create a Virtual Table straight from Power Pages with SQL and Sharepoint (lists)!

You can do this through the newly added -  connect to an external table data option.

These features will be in Private Preview in October!
