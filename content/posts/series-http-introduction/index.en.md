## Introduction

Welcome to my blog post series on HTTP SharePoint calls.

In this series, we'll dive into the different types of HTTP calls you can make to SharePoint, including GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. We'll explore the necessary permissions required for these calls and how to set them up correctly. Additionally, we'll cover the essential components of an HTTP request, such as headers and body, and explain how to structure them for successful communication with SharePoint.

Throughout the series, I'll try and give you some pointers of what I have discovered during the development, and hopefully you can follow my instructions to do http calls on your own.

Please let me know what else you'd like to see, or for me to expand upon.
