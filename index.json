Use GET for retrieving data, POST for creating new resources, PUT for updating existing resources, and DELETE for removing resources. This helps maintain clarity and consistency in your code.\nSet Proper Permissions Ensure that you have the necessary permissions for the operations you intend to perform. This includes configuring the appropriate access levels for users and applications. Proper permissions help prevent unauthorized access and maintain data security.\nInclude Necessary Headers HTTP headers play a crucial role in SharePoint calls. Always include essential headers such as Authorization, Accept, and Content-Type. These headers help authenticate requests, specify the expected response format, and indicate the type of data being sent.\nStructure the Request Body Correctly When making POST or PUT requests, ensure that the request body is properly structured. Use JSON format for data payloads and include all required fields. This helps SharePoint process your requests accurately and efficiently.\nHandle Errors Gracefully Implement error handling in your code to manage potential issues such as network failures, authentication errors, or invalid requests. Use appropriate status codes and messages to inform users about the nature of the error and possible solutions.\nOptimize for Performance Minimize the number of HTTP calls by batching requests when possible. Use pagination for large data sets and cache frequently accessed data to reduce server load and improve response times.\nSecure Your Requests Protect sensitive data by using HTTPS for all HTTP SharePoint calls. Encrypt data in transit and validate input to prevent security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).\nAvoid Deleting Columns with Parse JSON When working with Parse JSON, try to avoid deleting columns. Instead, adjust your schema to include only the necessary fields. This helps maintain data integrity and prevents potential issues.\nUse Variables in HTTP Calls Utilize variables for site names, list names, and other parameters in your HTTP calls. This makes your code more flexible and easier to maintain.\nGroup HTTP Calls in a GET Scope Try to group your HTTP calls within a GET scope and leverage the values in your Try block, preferably using variables. For more information on Get/Try/Catch, search for Power Automate error handling.\nReuse HTTP Calls Minimize the number of HTTP calls by reusing them where possible. This reduces the load on SharePoint servers and improves the efficiency of your application.\nHandle Large Datasets with Pagination Use pagination to handle large datasets and avoid overloading API responses. This improves responsiveness and reduces the load on SharePoint servers.\n","date":"February 20, 2025","hero":"/images/default-hero.jpg","permalink":"https://blog.nathalieleenders.com/posts/series-http-best-practises/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"best-practises\"\u003eBest practises\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere are some best practises I found either online or discovered myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"use-the-appropriate-http-method\"\u003eUse the Appropriate HTTP Method\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlways choose the correct HTTP method for your operation.

In this blog post, we\u0026rsquo;ll explore the powerful capabilities of JSON list formatting in SharePoint. JSON formatting allows you to customize the appearance of your lists and libraries, making them more user-friendly and visually appealing. We\u0026rsquo;ll cover how to get a flow identifier, add a column, set JSON formatting code, and additional button formatting options such as showing/hiding based on fields and permissions.\nGet Flow Identifier To begin, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to get the flow identifier for the specific flow you want to use. This identifier is essential for linking your JSON formatting to the flow. You can find the flow identifier in the URL of your flow in Power Automate. Simply navigate to your flow, and copy the identifier from the URL.\nAdd a Column Next, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to add a column to your SharePoint list. This column will be used to apply the JSON formatting. To add a column, follow these steps:\nGo to your SharePoint list. Click on the \u0026ldquo;Add column\u0026rdquo; button. Choose the type of column you want to add (e.g., Single line of text, Choice, etc.). Give your column a name and configure any additional settings as needed. Click \u0026ldquo;Save\u0026rdquo; to add the column to your list. Set JSON Formatting Code Now that you have your column, it\u0026rsquo;s time to set the JSON formatting code. JSON formatting allows you to define how the column should be displayed based on its value. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example of JSON formatting code:\n{ \u0026#34;elmType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;div\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;txtContent\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;@currentField\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;style\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;background-color\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;=if(@currentField == \u0026#39;Completed\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;#d4f4dd\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;#f4d4d4\u0026#39;)\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;padding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;5px\u0026#34; } } This code sets the background color of the column based on its value. If the value is \u0026ldquo;Completed,\u0026rdquo; the background color will be green; otherwise, it will be red.\nAdditional Button Formatting - Show/Hide Based on Fields You can also use JSON formatting to show or hide buttons based on the values of other fields. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example:\n{ \u0026#34;elmType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;button\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;txtContent\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Approve\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;style\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;display\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;=if([$Status] == \u0026#39;Pending\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;inline-block\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;none\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;customRowAction\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;action\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;setValue\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;actionInput\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;Status\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Approved\u0026#34; } } } In this example, the \u0026ldquo;Approve\u0026rdquo; button will only be displayed if the \u0026ldquo;Status\u0026rdquo; field is set to \u0026ldquo;Pending.\u0026rdquo;\nShow/Hide Based on Permissions\nYou can also control the visibility of buttons based on user permissions. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example:\n{ \u0026#34;elmType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;button\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;txtContent\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Delete\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;style\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;display\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;=if([$UserPermissions] == \u0026#39;FullControl\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;inline-block\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;none\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;customRowAction\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;action\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;delete\u0026#34; } } In this example, the \u0026ldquo;Delete\u0026rdquo; button will only be displayed if the user has \u0026ldquo;FullControl\u0026rdquo; permissions.\nVisual example: Or with a red background -\n\u0026#34;style\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;border\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;none\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;background-color\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;red\u0026#34; } ","date":"February 20, 2025","hero":"/images/default-hero.jpg","permalink":"https://blog.nathalieleenders.com/posts/series-http-callflowfrombutton/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"json-formatting-on-a-sharepoint-list\"\u003eJSON formatting on a sharepoint list?\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this blog post, we\u0026rsquo;ll explore the powerful capabilities of JSON list formatting in SharePoint.

To do this, you first need to get the type value from your library. This type value is essential for making the correct HTTP call to update the metadata field.\nStep 1: Get the Library Type Value After making a GET request to your library API, you will receive a response body that contains various details about your library. One of the key values you need to extract is the type, which is usually in the format SP.Data.listname. This type value is required to update the metadata field.\nFor example, if your list name is 01Firstlist, the type value might look like SP.Data.01Firstlistitem. However, to ensure accuracy and avoid hardcoding, it\u0026rsquo;s best to dynamically retrieve this value using an HTTP call.\nStep 2: Set the Type Value in a Variable Once you have retrieved the type value, you can store it in a variable. In this example, we will use a variable named varType of type string.\nStep 3: Use the Type Value in Your HTTP Call Now that you have the type value stored in varType, you can use it in your HTTP call to update the metadata field. Here is an example of how your request body should look:\n{ \u0026#34;__metadata\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;@{variables(\u0026#39;varType\u0026#39;)}\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;Name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Yes\u0026#34; } Example Code Here is a complete example of how you can achieve this:\nMake a GET request to retrieve the library details:\nGET https://yoursharepointsite/_api/web/lists/getbytitle(\u0026#39;YourListName\u0026#39;) Extract the type value from the response:\n{ \u0026#34;d\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;__metadata\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;SP.Data.01Firstlistitem\u0026#34; } } } Store the type value in a variable:\nvar varType = response.d.__metadata.type; Make a POST request to update the metadata field using the type value\nPOST https://yoursharepointsite/_api/web/lists/getbytitle(\u0026#39;YourListName\u0026#39;)/items(1) { \u0026#34;__metadata\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;@{variables(\u0026#39;varType\u0026#39;)}\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;Name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Yes\u0026#34; } By following these steps, you can dynamically retrieve the type value and use it to update metadata fields in SharePoint. This approach ensures that your code is flexible and can handle different list names without hardcoding the type value.\nWhen working with the SharePoint API, handling folders can sometimes be tricky, especially when dealing with deeply nested structures. In this post, we\u0026rsquo;ll explore how to dynamically grab the file location regardless of how deep it is in the root or folder structure. We\u0026rsquo;ll also cover how to handle common issues like permission errors.\nDynamically Grabbing the File Location To work with folders in the SharePoint API, you need to use the full path. This ensures that you can dynamically grab the file location, no matter how deep it is within the root or folder structure. Here\u0026rsquo;s a step-by-step guide:\nGet the Path Output from the Body When you make a request to the SharePoint API, the response body will contain the path information. This includes the root name, folder name, and other relevant details. Extract this path information from the response body.\nUse the Path in Your HTTP Requests Once you have the path, you can use it in your subsequent HTTP requests. This allows you to navigate through the folder structure dynamically. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example of how to do this:\nGET https://your-sharepoint-site/_api/web/GetFolderByServerRelativeUrl(\u0026#39;/sites/your-site/Shared Documents/FolderName\u0026#39;)/Files In this example, replace \u0026lsquo;/sites/your-site/Shared Documents/FolderName\u0026rsquo; with the path you extracted from the response body.\nCheck the File Path Ensure that the file path is correct. Double-check for any extra slashes (/) or missing segments in the path.\nVerify Permissions Make sure that you have the necessary permissions to access the folder or file. If you\u0026rsquo;re using an app or service account, ensure that it has the appropriate permissions.\nIf you encounter a permission error, it\u0026rsquo;s most likely a mistake in your path.

However these only work on Notes with attachments. My dataverse table/solution uses a files column.\nSo, I found a blogpost explaining how to do a canvas app component, rather than a custom page, and from there you can \u0026lsquo;just\u0026rsquo; embed the canvas app in a new tab, and all is well.\n(If I find the link again I will definately share it for you all)\nI created the canvas app, using the appropriate method, however when I loaded the app, I got a 0/0. No error, nothing in the inspect/developer tools, nothing to indicate an error. It does display the canvas app, and the pdf viewer, it just stays on 0/0. In the canvas app itself it\u0026rsquo;s perfectly fine, and gets the pdf from the [@ModelDrivenFormIntegration].Item.columnname.value\nWhen I was on a call with the amazing Hugo Bernier, I asked him about it, and this error popped up:\nHugo prompted me to check the array vs object, and that there might be different behavior expected.\nIn the meantime I also found an article explaining the different security permissions needed, and in particular this one:\nAfter doing this I was able to see text labels in my app that I put in as a test, with values, but not yet the actual invoice.\nThe solution Here\u0026rsquo;s the funny bit, so, it was expecting an array, however in the canvas app it needs the value, the object.\nI had to figure out a way to get the matching to work. I had thought about using First(), however that didnt work. Then did a date table, but that just gave me the columns and values, but not the above blob that I needed.\nI remembered doing a solution, after watching a video by Shane Young, on uploading attachments from a canvas app, to Power Automate, parsing the blob through, and remembered he used a Gallery.\nI went back into my canvas app (remember, go to the component and add it there, don\u0026rsquo;t edit straight from the power apps interface, it will mess up the [@ModelDrivenFormIntegration] thing)\nI created a gallery, and on it, used the following expression:\nFilter(Dataversecolumnname,ThisRecord.GUIDfield = [@ModelDrivenFormIntegration].Item.GUIDfield)\nThen on the PDF viewer, I did Gallery1.Selected.Invoicefiles.Value Essentially, I match the GUID field from my datasource, with the value it retrieves through the ModelDrivenFormIntegration.\nI hid the gallery (Set my visible property to false) published and closed out the app. Long story short, the PDF viewer in a canvas app works with the single object, that it directly gets from the Canvas UI, using the [@ModelDrivenFormIntegration]. However the Model Driven app, doesnt have this step, and it receives an object, but wants an array, so it misses the thing the canvass app does to translate the data.\nDoes it make sense? Not really.

I have had tremendous help from my colleague Laurens Hoogendoorn, who is completely awesome and helps me run with javascript (see what I did there) before learning how to crawl or walk. LOL. Laurens, you are the best!\nSo, let me start at the beginning.\nThere are a few steps needed, first to understand how Power Pages works with forms. Then how to create a Power Automate cloud flow. Then create your form, create your flow, add javascript to call said flow and voila. But don\u0026rsquo;t worry, I will walk you through it.\nFollow the instructions of this learn article Next step is to follow this Microsoft learn article:\nMy power Automate flow Once you\u0026rsquo;ve followed the steps, take note of the CSRF token. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to remember that.\nAn excerpt: * Authenticating cloud flow API requests You don\u0026rsquo;t need to include an authentication code, because the application session manages authentication and authorization. All API calls must include a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) token.\nThis is a tricky one, if you dont include this your flow won\u0026rsquo;t be called. In the example they give, in the code, take note of the following piece:\nshell.ajaxSafePost({ type: \u0026#34;POST\u0026#34;, contentType: \u0026#34;application/json\u0026#34;, url: \u0026#34;_api/cloudflow/v1.0/trigger/44a4b2f2-0d1a-4820-bf93-9376278d49c4\u0026#34;, data: JSON.stringify({\u0026#34;eventData\u0026#34;:JSON.stringify({\u0026#34;Email\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;abc@contoso.com\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;File\u0026#34;:{\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Report.pdf\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;contentBytes\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;base 64 encoded string\u0026#34;} })}), processData: false, global: false }) .done(function (response) { }) .fail(function(){ }); Create your Power Pages form Create your form, and in this case I have a field called temperatuur.\nI add this field in a step (I have a multi step form) and make sure to add a description.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not defining the description in my javascript, make sure you do, however as it\u0026rsquo;s my only one it\u0026rsquo;s not relevant for now.\nOnce you have the field in your form, go to Example, and hit F12 developer tools.\nIdentify your field name Go to your selector, and mark the field you need for your code. I used cr696_temperatuur, but you\u0026rsquo;ll need to find and change your value.\nThe Javascript needed to call the flow // Function to call the Power Automate flow with the temperature value function callPowerAutomateFlow() { // Retrieve the value of the cr696_temperatuur field, make sure to replace with your field name! const temperatureValue = document.getElementById(\u0026#39;cr696_temperatuur\u0026#39;).value; // URL of your Power Automate flow const flowUrl = \u0026#39;copy the url of the flow you added to your power pages\u0026#39;; // Prepare the payload with the temperature value const payload = { Location: temperatureValue }; const payload2 = { eventData: JSON.stringify(payload) }; //this is the CFS token, you need this to call the flow. Without this, it wont work! shell .ajaxSafePost({ type: \u0026#34;POST\u0026#34;, contentType: \u0026#34;application/json\u0026#34;, url: flowUrl, data: JSON.stringify(payload2), processData: false, global: false, }) .then(response =\u0026gt; { // Assuming the flow returns data that you want to display // Display the return value in an element, e.g., with class \u0026#39;description\u0026#39; const result = JSON.parse(response); document.querySelector(\u0026#39;.description\u0026#39;).innerText = result[\u0026#34;temperature\u0026#34;]; }) .catch(error =\u0026gt; { console.error(\u0026#39;Error calling Power Automate flow:\u0026#39;, error); }); } // Add event listeners to the cr696_temperatuur field for keydown and change events function setupTemperatureFieldListener() { const temperatureField = document.getElementById(\u0026#39;cr696_temperatuur\u0026#39;); if (!temperatureField) { console.error(\u0026#39;Temperature field not found\u0026#39;); return; } // Function to handle the events const handleEvent = () =\u0026gt; { // Call the Power Automate flow with the current value of the temperature field callPowerAutomateFlow(); }; // Listen for both keydown and change events temperatureField.addEventListener(\u0026#39;keydown\u0026#39;, handleEvent); temperatureField.addEventListener(\u0026#39;change\u0026#39;, handleEvent); } // Initialize the event listeners when the document is fully loaded document.addEventListener(\u0026#39;DOMContentLoaded\u0026#39;, setupTemperatureFieldListener); Test your script So, copy this code, into your Developer tool. Do ctrl-z. Call your javascript function, in my case: setupTemperatureFieldListener() and do another ctrl-z Type something in your field, and see if it returns the value from your Power Automate flow into your description. Implement the script Once you\u0026rsquo;re satisfied, copy/paste your code into the Visual Studio code editor, for your specific Form step, into the Javascript container.\nHit ctrl-s, and you\u0026rsquo;re golden.\n","date":"July 17, 2024","hero":"/posts/callpowerautomateflowfrompowerpagesform/powerpagesflow.png","permalink":"https://blog.nathalieleenders.com/posts/callpowerautomateflowfrompowerpagesform/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"calling-a-power-automate-flow-from-a-dataverse-form-in-a-power-page-form\"\u003eCalling a Power Automate flow from a dataverse form, in a Power Page form\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSounds easy right?

Specific bookmarks you can call PowerBI Premium License Export to image enabled in PowerBI Admin center Azure blob storage (not OneDrive) Make sure the image is 25KB Max How to do this: Prepare your PowerBI Report Create bookmarks to call\nCreate filters and set the bookmarks accordingly\nSet up Azure BLOB Storage so you can leverage it in your flow\nCreate a Power Automate Flow Trigger: When a keyword is mentioned in Power Automate\nActions:\nGet Message Details for Teams, grabbing the trigger message ID Export to file (PNG) for Power BI Reports Set bookmark Name and State Save as image on Azure Blog Storage Create a Teams Adaptive card in adaptivecard.IO Designer Reply with adaptive card designer that responds to the keyword Get me, and Sales overview of 2023 Save and test your flow!\nOh and don\u0026rsquo;t forget to pray, don\u0026rsquo;t include your trigger word in your reply, and troubleshoot your JSON code if it doesnt work.\nGood luck!\nAfter I posted this blog, I got in touch with Luuk Postuma, who had been trying to get this to work, and he has shared his feedback so we can all learn from it:\nI attended Nathalie’s session at MPPC 2023 and cam home very excited to try this out. But, when it came to the details, I immediately ran into issues and bombarded Nathalie with a bunch of emails. The main issue I was having (among others) was that I only have a Power BI Premium-Per-User license and I just could not get it to work. I also have a Fabric 60-day trial, and figured that should be enough for me to use the “Export To File for Power BI Reports”\nBased on some Google searches, it appeared that I would need a full Power BI Premium license, but after some more digging and trial and error, I learned that I was wrong!\nYou can use “Export to File for Power BI Reports” with a Premium-Per-User license and a Fabric Trial license!!\nHere is the step I missed:\nYou have to create a Power BI Workspace that uses the Fabric Trial capacity. To do this, go to your app.powerbi.com, select the settings gear at the top right and then select “Admin portal”, then select “Workspaces”. Then, select the Trial option:\nAt this point, you should be good to test the solution until your Fabric Trial runs out. What I’ll do then depends on how much money my company wants to spend 😉\nNow, for a few notes on using the “Export to File for Power BI Reports” action. Let me explain my simple test flow first. It goes like this: If a keyword (in this case ‘revenue’) is used in a specific Teams channel, I want it to export my Power BI revenue report to a .png file and then send it as an attachment in an email. At a high level, it looks like this:\nIn the right branch, Teams simply responds to say “You will receive an email with the report in a minute” (because for me it typically takes 40 to 60 seconds). The left branch takes care of the .png export and emailing. The first part (Export to File….) looks like this:\nThe Workspace value should be a workspace that you enabled as your Fabric (or Fabric Trial) workspace. The Report is the Report in that workspace. The Export Format can be PDF, PPTX or PNG. For an image, choose PNG.\nI also wanted to include a filter, and that took a bit of Googling too. But you can find a decent reference here (which relates to urls but work in this context too – instead of using URL?filter=Table/Field eq ‘value’ just use Table/Field eq ‘value’):\nFilter a report using query string parameters in the URL - Power BI | Microsoft Learn (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-url-filters)\nOne note on this is that if you already have filters in your report, the filter you define in the Export to File settings will not work.\nAnother thing I could not get to work was extracting just a visual from the report. Nathalie suggested just taking the visual, copying it to a new page, and then referencing that page instead. If you leave the filter off the new page and use a filter as I’ve shown in the Export to File settings, this will work best.\nAnother thing to be aware of is that your table name (if used in the ReportLevelFilters Filter expression) should not contain spaces. At first (using the example above) I was using my ‘Date Table’, but after it didn’t work right, I changed the table name in my PBIX file to ‘DateTable’ and then the filter started working.\nFor the Pages pageName section, do not use the actual display name for the report. Instead, you will find that in the URL of your report.\nIn the next step, I used the Send an email (V2) to send the image as an attachment, using the ‘Body’ result from the “Export to File from Power BI” step:\nFinally, when this is all done, I post another reply to the Teams channel indicating that the file has been sent as shown here:\nAnd that’s it!\nWould I use this flow in real life? I would definitely make some improvements – for example, using an adaptive card to ask for the date parameters and then passing that on to the ReportLevelFilters Filter expression in the “Export to File from Power BI” section. I would also need to capture the name/email address of the user that posted in Teams so that the email would go to them (I only tested with myself). And, I might not reply to the messages in Teams per se, as anyone in the channel would see them and I wouldn’t want everyone to be inundated with those message.\nI hope this helps!\nI really thank Luuk for his dedication in making this work, and we hope it helps somebody!\n","date":"October 17, 2023","hero":"/posts/powerbiinadaptivecards/powerbireport.png","permalink":"https://blog.nathalieleenders.com/posts/powerbiinadaptivecards/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"usecase\"\u003eUsecase\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou want to show a report in Microsoft Teams, or when someone requests a sales overview of 2022, a card appears with that report in it.

You need these to identify the start and end of a protected section. (it wont tell you start-end, you’ll have to test by enabling protection, but we’re getting ahead of ourselves here) Scenario\nLet’s say you want this to be edited.\nAnd this to be read only.\nYou do as follows:\nInsert Continuous Section break (Start) Let\u0026rsquo;s say you want this to be read only. Insert Continuous Section break (End) This section is now protected.\nAnd this to be edited.\nIf you leave it open it can be edited\nI make it easier for myself by giving the Section break it’s own line, so it’s easier to see where they are.\nScenario\nLets say you want this to be read only.\nQuestion read only.\nAnd this to be the answer section or adding attachments.\nDo the following:\nInsert Continuous Section break (Start) Lets say you want this to be read only. Insert Continuous Section break (End) Insert Continuous Section break (Start) Question read only Insert Continuous Section break (End) And this to be the answer section or adding attachments Insert Continuous Section break (Start) With me so far?\nThis example shows how that’s enabled, perhaps that helps.

I used https://pcf.gallery/csv-dropdown-control/ from https://pcf.gallery/authors#ivan_ficko\nImport the Managed Solution Go to your components menu on the left, Add in the component On your value field, in classic mode, open the properties Go to Controls Under the properties add in your csv values (use delimiter ; ) (I had to dive into the .js code for that one) Now it’s a value field, that behaves like a dropdown, but is still being seen as the value field, and not a foreign body trying to be updated.\nNow onto the fun part:\nOld content - Disclaimer - This does not work!

Old blogpost for reference only, or, how to use business rules to fill a field value I’m developing a solution with a SQL data backend. Using Virtual Tables I’ve mapped my SQL DB’s to Dataverse. I need quite a lot of dropdown/optionsets in my forms, but my SQL column is NVARCHAR (string/text) There is no choice column in SQL available.\nSo how do I go around this?\nI’ve started thinking about the good old ‘Patch’ capability, to have a stand alone dropdown, patch the value to a field and that works.\nA colleague found an old optionset D365 blog post, and this is how we solved the issue:\nCreate a choice in your solution. For this I’ll go with City1 Add the values you need to that choice (City1) In your form, add the column you need (City2) Add a new field, choice, choose from the existing Optionset you created in the first step Double click on this new field Go to Business Rules Add a new rule If City1 field value matches “New York” Update Field Value for City2 to “New York” Hide the City2 field as it’s not needed to show, City1 will have the dropdown, City2 will do the actual upload.\nNow when you select New York from the dropdown in City1, it automatically does the same for City2 which is where the historical data also resides.\nThis might be a bit convoluted, if you have another way please let me know \u0026#x1f64f; .\n","date":"February 14, 2023","hero":"/posts/dataversechoices-sqlbackend/powerapps-logo.png","permalink":"https://blog.nathalieleenders.com/posts/dataversechoices-sqlbackend/","summary":"","tags":["SQL","Virtual Tables"],"title":"Dataverse Choices to SQL backend- Update!"},{"categories":["Github"],"contents":"This has to be the best thing to come out of 2023 (and yes, it’s only January so that’s saying something)\nMy longest blog post and read to date, but I promise you it’s worth it!\nI was on the First Time Contributor training yesterday, one of the Sharing is Caring sessions led by David Warner and Hugo Bernier.

Make sure on the right-hand side, to add an ID element to your button or choice field. This ID Element is important so you can recognize your data later on in the PARSE JSON step.\nOnce designed you can copy the code from the lower left corner Card Payload Editor into a text editor (to save for later/backup) or paste directly in your Flow. The new Cards Preview function offers the same functionality, however while I find the UI easier to use, the technical coding backend to it doesn’t give you an error when you don’t specify the ID.\nYour flow run will fail as it needs this parameter. To bypass, I copy/paste the code from the Card Preview option, into the Card Payload Editor from Adaptivecards.IO and check for an error there.\nPower Automate Once you designed your card, insert it in your Power Automate Flow: Add a step, click on Teams, Post an adaptive card and wait for a response. Choose your channel or chat option, and in the body copy/paste the code from the designer or adaptive card in your adaptive card message body. Use cases for adaptive cards:\nApprovals Needing information through text output Different choices of material, feedback or other choice options (Optional) I like to add a variable at the top level of my Power Automate Flow, something like VarColor so I can store the information from the output from the Parse JSON. You can of course just keep it as regular dynamic content. (If you’re using different nested steps a variable may be easier to work with)\nAfter your Teams card, add an action for Parse JSON (JSON sounds scary but I’ll walk you through it) On outputs, type the name of your card step, add _for spaces. Example: outputs(’Post_adaptive_card_and_wait_for_a_response’)?[’body’] On the schema area type {} Run your flow and check the run. Copy the full output of the Teams adaptive card Go back into edit, and in your Parse JSON step, click on Generate from Sample Paste the whole body there. Complete/save Now the output that’s in your newly generated schema will appear as Dynamic content.\nI like to Append to string Variable the Data for Color for example, but of course you can leave this step out.\nHope this helps, let me know if you have any questions.\n","date":"October 19, 2022","hero":"/posts/adaptivecards/MS_Teams_logo_ws.png","permalink":"https://blog.nathalieleenders.com/posts/adaptivecards/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAdaptive cards is the name for the pop-up you can get in Teams, with custom content asking you to confirm something, or to submit a remark.\nOne way of creating them is through Adaptive card Designer (JSON).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother way is to use the new Cards (preview) method in PowerApps maker - find out how here: Microsoft Learn Page - \u003ca href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/cards/overview/?wt.mc_id=DX-MVP-5005318\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ehttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/cards/overview/?wt.mc_id=DX-MVP-5005318\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you want to use your adaptive card as for example an approval, or you want the color choice you need to get the data that the card receives.\u003c/p\u003e","tags":["Microsoft Teams","Adaptive Cards"],"title":"Get output from Adaptive Card choice sets"},{"categories":null,"contents":"","date":"January 1, 0001","hero":"/images/default-hero.jpg","permalink":"https://blog.nathalieleenders.com/posts/alias/","summary":"","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"contents":"A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z | A AI Builder Use AI models to enhance your Power Automate Flow or PowerApps, for example extract values (Character recognition) from a pdf upon receiving the file in an email.
